% This function computes one iteration of the energy-minimization of
% active contour models described in the paper "Using Dynamic Programming
% for Solving Variational Problems in Vision" by Amir A. Amini, Terry E.
% Weymouth, and Ramesh C. Jain, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and
% Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No. 9, September 1990, pp 855-867.
%
% Snakes align a contour to some feature maxima in an image (for example)
% image boundaries) using dynamic programming.  The quality of the
% alignment is measured by an energy function consisting of an internal
% "contour-smoothness-term" and an external feature term (equation 50 in the
% paper).  Minimizing this energy term leads to a contour that trade offs
% these two criterias (smoothness + maximal feature responses) in some desired
% way.
%
% Inputs:
%   pnts          Starting contour. Each row is a [x,y] coordinate.
%   alpha         Energy contributed by the distance between control points.
%                 Set to zero if length of slope doesn't matter.
%   beta          Energy contributed by the curvature of the snake.  Larger
%                 values of beta cause bends in the snake to have a high cost
%                 and lead to smoother snakes.
%   max_delta_y   Max number of pixels to move each contour point vertically
%   resol_y       Contour points will be moved by multiples of resol_y
%   max_delta_x   Analog to max_delta_y
%   resol_x       Analog to resol_y
%   feat_img      2D-Array of the feature responses in the image.  For example
%                 it can contain the magnitude of the image gradients
%
% Outputs:
%   snake_pnts    New contour points.
%   e             Energy value of these new contour points
